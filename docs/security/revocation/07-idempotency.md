# 07 — Idempotency

`ControlPlaneService.revokeGrant(input: RevokeGrantInput)` — `runtime/controlPlane.ts`.

## Rules implemented

| Rule | Behavior | Test |
|---|---|---|
| Same `idempotency_key` + same `{grant_id, reason}` | Returns the original `RevokeGrantResult` with `idempotentReplay: true`; no re-mutation, no duplicate evidence | "same idempotency_key + same payload replays..." |
| Same `idempotency_key` + different `grant_id`/`reason` | Throws `RevocationIdempotencyConflictError` (`IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT:<key>`); the *other* grant referenced by the conflicting call is left untouched | "same idempotency_key + different payload is a conflict..." |
| Retry with no idempotency key, same grant, already revoked | Returns the original result (`idempotentReplay: true`); `revoked_at` does **not** move forward | "retry after a hypothetical timeout ... does not duplicate revocation state" |
| Revoke an already-revoked grant (any caller, any key) | Same as above — revoking twice is a stable no-op, not an error and not a fresh mutation | "removes the grant from listActiveGrants once revoked" + already-revoked branch in `revokeGrant` |
| Two logically concurrent calls, same key | Converge on one `revocationId`, one evidence record | "two revocations racing for the same grant converge on one revocation, not two" |

## Fingerprinting

The idempotency cache key is `idempotency_key` (caller-supplied); the value is
`{ fingerprint, result }` where `fingerprint = JSON.stringify({ grant_id, reason })`. A conflict is
detected by fingerprint mismatch under the same key, not by grant identity alone — this is what
lets rule 2 above catch "same key reused for an unrelated request" rather than only "same key,
same grant, different reason".

## What's explicitly *not* built

- No cross-process/cross-restart persistence of the idempotency cache — it's a `Map` in the same
  process-memory store as everything else in `ControlPlaneService`. A caller retrying across a
  process restart will not get replay protection. This is the same documented limitation as
  `06-cascade-design.md`'s atomicity section: honest in-memory behavior, not a claim of durable
  guarantees.
- No idempotency-key TTL/eviction — keys accumulate for the process lifetime. Acceptable for the
  current in-memory scope; a real store would need an expiry policy.
