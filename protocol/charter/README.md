# Architects of Change Protocol — Charter
Architects of Change Protocol is an open, neutral and public protocol designed to enable digital sovereignty for individuals and nations.

1. Purpose
Its purpose is to provide a foundational architecture where:

Individuals own and control their data.
Nations can guarantee digital rights at infrastructure level.
Markets consume data only through explicit, verifiable consent.
A collaborative, citizen-owned data economy can emerge.
This protocol does not belong to any company, government, or private entity.
It belongs to humanity.

2. Core Principles
   
2.1 Self-Sovereignty
Every human being is the primary owner of their digital identity and data.
No platform, corporation, or state is the default owner of a person’s information.

2.2 Consent-First Architecture

All data access must be: Explicit, Granular, Revocable, Purpose-bound. Silently harvested data is incompatible with this protocol.

2.3 Local First, Global Compatible

Individuals and nations may implement local infrastructure. All implementations must remain compatible with the open protocol interfaces. No central authority controls adoption.

2.4 Minimal Trust Surfaces

The protocol minimizes trusted intermediaries. Security emerges from: Cryptography, Deterministic rules, Verifiable execution, Open inspection, Not from institutional promises.

2.5 Market Neutrality

The protocol does not favor any vertical, industry, or economic model. Any market may build on top: Employment, Health, Finance, Education, Energy, Mobility, Governance, Others

3. What This Protocol Defines

The protocol defines: Sovereign Data Wallet concept, Sovereign Data Language (SDL), Consent handshake flows, Market Schema request format, Interoperability primitives
The protocol does NOT define: Business models, User interfaces, National policies, Token prices, Corporate strategies. Those belong to implementers or market makers.

4. Architectural Layers

High level layers: Sovereign Wallet (individual storage & signing), Sovereign Data Language (universal field vocabulary), Market Makers (vertical engines), Governance & Charter, Token / Incentive layers (optional), Each layer is modular, No layer is mandatory except the Charter.

5. Individual as Architect

Each individual is considered: The architect of their own digital system. They may: Create data fields, Populate information, Group fields, Approve schemas, Revoke access, Migrate infrastructure, The protocol assumes human agency as a first-class primitive.

6. Nation as Digital Rights Guarantor

Nations may adopt the protocol as public digital infrastructure to: Guarantee citizen data ownership, Enforce consent standards, Provide sovereign wallet issuance, Certify compliant markets, Adoption is voluntary and non-exclusive.

7. Open Source Commitment

All protocol specifications: Are public, Are open source, Are versioned, Are auditable. Reference implementations may vary. Specifications remain neutral.

8. Governance Philosophy

Governance favors: Rough consensus, Open discussion, Transparent proposals, Public version history, No hidden governance, No closed councils.

9. Non-Goals

The protocol is NOT: A social network, A blockchain, A company, A single product, A replacement for all systems. It is an interoperability and sovereignty layer.

10. Charter Evolution

This Charter is a living document. Changes require: Public proposal, Public discussion, Versioned acceptance, Historical versions remain accessible.
