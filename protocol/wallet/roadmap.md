# AOC Protocol — Roadmap
**Version:** 0.1  
**Status:** Draft  
**Focus:** Sovereign Wallet Vault (mobile-first) as the primary interface for schema resolution, consent, and economic flows.

---

## Product North Star

**The Sovereign Wallet is a mobile-first vault that resolves schemas, manages consent, and acts as the primary recipient of economic flows generated by market access to user data.**

In practice:
- Markets publish schemas (requested data shapes + constraints + formats + payout terms).
- The Wallet ingests schemas, auto-resolves fields from the vault, requests missing fields from the user, and outputs a signed response pack.
- Every approved access request triggers non-custodial payments directly to the sovereign wallet (with configurable revenue splits).

---

## Scope Principles

1. **Canonical data in the Vault, formatted exports for markets**  
   The Vault stores canonical representations. Markets may request specific output formats. The Resolver renders requested formats via deterministic transforms.

2. **Deterministic first, AI optional later**  
   v0.x Resolver must be auditable and predictable. AI may exist only as a suggestion layer and must never finalize lossy or ambiguous transforms without explicit user confirmation.

3. **Non-custodial by default**  
   No internal balances. No platform custody. No accounts required to receive payouts.

## Milestones

### P0 — Core Sovereign Wallet (Resolver + Consent)
**Goal:** End-to-end flow: ingest schema → resolve fields → request consent → produce response pack → record audit trail.

**Deliverables**
- Wallet Vault (canonical field store)
- Schema intake and validation
- Deterministic Resolver Engine
- Consent & capability authorization
- Signed response pack generation

---

### P1 — Portability & UX (Mobile-first)
**Goal:** Make the wallet truly portable and notification-driven.

**Deliverables**
- iOS / Android wallet app
- Resolver + consent UI
- Push notifications + email fallback
- Request inbox (pending / approved / denied)

---

### P2 — Economic Flows
**Goal:** Wallet as the economic hub.

**Deliverables**
- Non-custodial payment receipt
- Revenue split preview & execution
- Earnings history and provenance

---

### P3 — Advanced Interop & Intelligence (Optional)
**Goal:** Improve compatibility without sacrificing sovereignty.

**Deliverables**
- Advanced schema mappings
- Reusable consent packs
- Optional AI suggestion layer (never authoritative)

---

## Format & Transform Policy (v0.1)

- Vault stores canonical data
- Markets request output formats
- Resolver renders exports

**Transform levels**
1. Exact match
2. Safe deterministic transform
3. Requires user confirmation

---

## Notes

- The Wallet is the primary surface area for users.
- Markets compete to send schemas and payouts to sovereign wallets.
- External helpers are optional and must never be custodial.
