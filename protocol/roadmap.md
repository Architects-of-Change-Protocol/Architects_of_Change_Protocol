# AOC Protocol — Roadmap
**Version:** 0.1  
**Status:** Draft  
**Focus:** Sovereign Wallet Vault (mobile-first) as the primary interface for schema resolution, consent, and economic flows.

---

## Product North Star

**The Sovereign Wallet is a mobile-first vault that resolves schemas, manages consent, and acts as the primary recipient of economic flows generated by market access to user data.**

In practice:
- Markets publish schemas (requested data shapes + constraints + formats + payout terms).
- The Wallet ingests schemas, auto-resolves fields from the vault, requests missing fields from the user, and outputs a signed response pack.
- Every approved access request triggers non-custodial payments directly to the sovereign wallet (with configurable revenue splits).

---

## Schematics & Sovereign Storage Decisions (Foundational)

### Core Principles
- The Sovereign Wallet Vault is a **control plane**, NOT a bulk data repository.
- User data is composed of **modular schematics** (schema-defined statements), NOT a single master profile or giant form.
- **Hash ≠ access**: integrity identifiers are decoupled from physical storage location.

### Data Model (Minimum)
- **Schema (Blueprint)**: versioned definition of a schematic (fields, types, semantics).
- **Statement (Instance)**: a signed, timestamped instantiation of a schema for a subject.
- **Wallet Index Entry** (stored in wallet): { statement_id, schema_id, issuer, created_at, hash, locator, sensitivity }.
- **Consent Rule**: signed policy describing who can access what, for what purpose, and for how long.

### Storage & Privacy
- Default to **user-controlled storage** (e.g., user cloud) for encrypted statement blobs.
- Require **E2E encryption before persistence** (storage provider is blind).
- Wallet stores keys + index + consent rules; content lives outside wallet as encrypted blobs.
- On-chain usage is limited to **audit events** (emit/grant/revoke/proof), never personal content.

### UX Guardrails (Non-negotiable)
- Users should never manage files/hashes/providers directly.
- UX primitives are: “Add schematic”, “Share/Grant access”, “Revoke access”, “Issue proof”.

### Roadmap Phases
- Phase: Schematics Foundation
  - Define Schema/Statement/Index data model
  - Implement wallet index (minimum viable)
  - Implement encryption + locator abstraction (hash/location decoupling)
  - Implement user-controlled storage adapter (initial provider)
- Phase: Consent & Access Layer
  - Signed consent rules
  - Access evaluation (purpose + scope + expiry)
  - Partial disclosure proofs (where applicable)
  - On-chain audit events for consent lifecycle

### Dependencies / Notes
- Consent & capability tokens depend on “Schematics Foundation” being in place.
- Storage provider is replaceable; wallet index is the source of truth.

## Scope Principles

1. **Canonical data in the Vault, formatted exports for markets**  
   The Vault stores canonical representations. Markets may request specific output formats. The Resolver renders requested formats via deterministic transforms.

2. **Deterministic first, AI optional later**  
   v0.x Resolver must be auditable and predictable. AI may exist only as a suggestion layer and must never finalize lossy or ambiguous transforms without explicit user confirmation.

3. **Non-custodial by default**  
   No internal balances. No platform custody. No accounts required to receive payouts.

## Milestones

### P0 — Core Sovereign Wallet (Resolver + Consent)
**Goal:** End-to-end flow: ingest schema → resolve fields → request consent → produce response pack → record audit trail.

**Deliverables**
- Wallet Vault (canonical field store)
- Schema intake and validation
- Deterministic Resolver Engine
- Consent & capability authorization
- Signed response pack generation

---

### P1 — Portability & UX (Mobile-first)
**Goal:** Make the wallet truly portable and notification-driven.

**Deliverables**
- iOS / Android wallet app
- Resolver + consent UI
- Push notifications + email fallback
- Request inbox (pending / approved / denied)

---

### P2 — Economic Flows
**Goal:** Wallet as the economic hub.

**Deliverables**
- Non-custodial payment receipt
- Revenue split preview & execution
- Earnings history and provenance

---

### P3 — Advanced Interop & Intelligence (Optional)
**Goal:** Improve compatibility without sacrificing sovereignty.

**Deliverables**
- Advanced schema mappings
- Reusable consent packs
- Optional AI suggestion layer (never authoritative)

---

## Format & Transform Policy (v0.1)

- Vault stores canonical data
- Markets request output formats
- Resolver renders exports

**Transform levels**
1. Exact match
2. Safe deterministic transform
3. Requires user confirmation

---

## Notes

- The Wallet is the primary surface area for users.
- Markets compete to send schemas and payouts to sovereign wallets.
- External helpers are optional and must never be custodial.
