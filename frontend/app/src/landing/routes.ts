// Central route constants for the marketing site.
//
// The site is a hybrid of query-param "views" (`?view=x`) and clean paths,
// dispatched in src/App.tsx. This file exists so every nav/footer/CTA link
// references one canonical string instead of retyping `/?view=enterprise`
// in a dozen files.
//
// Information architecture (approved): Protocol is the open foundation.
// Enterprise is the commercial umbrella built on Protocol, and owns
// Solutions (Governed Access), Services (Assurance), Architecture, and
// Developers. See ROUTES.enterprise.* for that hierarchy.
