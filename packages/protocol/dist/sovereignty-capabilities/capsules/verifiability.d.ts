/**
 * AOC.VERIFIABILITY — the production Sovereignty Capability capsule that
 * answers:
 *
 *   "Given a sovereign artifact and the proof attached to it, can an
 *    independent party determine whether that proof is cryptographically and
 *    structurally sound — without trusting whoever presented it, without the
 *    originating runtime, and without changing the artifact?"
 *
 * It is the sixth of the canonical eight to become a real implementation of the
 * SM-03 socket. The cryptographic primitives it consumes already existed in
 * `@aoc/protocol/manifest` — `verifySovereignManifest`, `verifySignedClaim` (by
 * way of `verifySignedSovereignClaim`) and `verifySovereignSignature`. This
 * capsule is what exposes them through the common capability socket, so a
 * consumer holding only the published package can ask the question and get an
 * answer that is attributable, machine-readable and honest about what it did
 * not check.
 *
 * ## Three operations, deliberately
 *
 *   verify-signed-manifest   SignedSovereignManifest   -> manifest verification report
 *   verify-signed-claim      SignedClaim               -> claim verification report
 *   verify-sovereign-proof   payload + SovereignProof  -> proof verification report
 *
 * That is the whole surface. There is no `generate-key-pair`, `sign-manifest`,
 * `sign-claim` or `sign-payload` operation, and that omission is a design
 * decision rather than missing work — see "Verification-first" below.
 *
 * ## What a passing verification establishes
 *
 * At most: *the holder of the private key matching the proof's public key
 * signed this canonical payload*, plus — only when `issuerBinding` is
 * `verified` — *the resolver the caller supplied binds that key id to the
 * asserted issuer*. It establishes nothing else. Specifically it does **not**
 * establish that the assertion is historically true, that the issuer owns the
 * subject, that a derivation was authorized, that copyright or a licence
 * exists, that a court would accept the claim, that the claim is uncontested,
 * or that any system should act on it.
 *
 *     signature valid          != assertion true
 *     digest valid             != legal ownership
 *     issuer key bound         != issuer factually correct
 *     cryptographically valid  != uncontested
 *     verification result      != governance decision
 *
 * ## Verification-first: no signing, no keys
 *
 * The capsule verifies and never produces proofs. A production signer needs an
 * explicit key-management architecture, and the SM-03 invocation input is a
 * generic transport shared by every capability — turning it into a carrier for
 * `privateKeyPem`, seed phrases, KMS secrets or wallet secrets would solve the
 * wrong problem and put key material somewhere no capability contract should
 * put it. So no operation here accepts private key material, nothing here
 * calls `generateSovereignKeyPair`, and nothing here calls
 * `signSovereignManifest`, `signClaim` or `signSovereignPayload`. Those
 * primitives remain public, unchanged and directly usable by issuers,
 * fixtures and applications that have their own key management. A managed
 * signer/KMS abstraction is deferred rather than invented here.
 *
 * ## Verifiability is not Integrity
 *
 * `verify-signed-manifest` deliberately accepts **no** content bytes. The
 * underlying `verifySovereignManifest` primitive supports them; this capsule
 * calls it without them, and the resulting `contentDigest: 'not_performed'` is
 * the honest report of a check nobody asked for. Accepting bytes here would
 * make the mineral boundary "Verifiability secretly performs Integrity". A
 * caller who wants both runs AOC.INTEGRITY over the bytes and AOC.VERIFIABILITY
 * over the signed manifest, correlating the two invocations with one
 * `correlationId`. Nothing in this module ever turns `not_performed` into
 * `valid`.
 *
 * ## What this capsule never does
 *
 * - **Sign, or hold keys.** No signing operation, no key generation, no key
 *   storage, no rotation, no PKI, no global key registry, no trusted key store.
 * - **Reimplement cryptography.** No second canonicalizer, SHA implementation,
 *   Ed25519 verifier, base64url decoder or signature engine exists here. Where
 *   a granular reason cannot be obtained from a current primitive, a truthful
 *   coarse reason is reported instead of duplicating cryptographic logic.
 * - **Broaden the algorithm surface.** `aoc-canonical-json/1` + SHA-256 +
 *   Ed25519 remain the only profile. No secp256k1, ECDSA, RSA, BLS, P-256,
 *   Keccak, SHA-3, multihash, wallet or chain signature format is interpreted.
 * - **Check revocation.** No `RevocationLookup`, no OCSP, no CRL, no credential
 *   status. A `verified` issuer binding does **not** imply a non-revoked key.
 * - **Build a trust chain.** No X.509, CA path, DID resolution, web of trust or
 *   trust registry. A binding is only as authoritative as the resolver the
 *   caller injected, and Protocol assigns no trust of its own.
 * - **Apply time policy.** `proof.signedAt` is preserved and read, never turned
 *   into an expiry, freshness or key-validity-window rule that no canonical
 *   primitive owns.
 * - **Score.** No trust, confidence, credibility, reputation, assurance or risk
 *   score. Every check reports `valid`/`invalid`/`not_performed`, never "87%".
 * - **Decide.** No allow, deny, approve, reject, grant, block or enforce. A
 *   governance system may later require that verification passed; that is its
 *   policy, not this capsule's output.
 * - **Adjudicate.** No standing is read or written. `contestClaim` is not
 *   called, no `StandingStatus` is assigned, and a claim whose signature
 *   verifies can be `Contested` at the same moment without contradiction.
 * - **Record.** No `CanonicalVerification` is created — a cryptographic check
 *   is not a verifier's assessment of whether a claim is true — no
 *   `VerificationStatus` is widened, no `VerificationProvider` is required, and
 *   nothing is persisted.
 * - **Mutate.** The manifest, claim, proof and payload handed in are read and
 *   returned untouched. No public key is normalized, no `keyId` rewritten, no
 *   `payloadHash` repaired, no signature replaced, no artifact re-signed and no
 *   canonicalized rewrite returned as a "fixed" artifact. A broken proof stays
 *   broken.
 * - **Invoke another mineral.** `invokeSovereigntyCapability` is not called
 *   here. Identity is not asked to mint, Integrity is not asked to hash,
 *   Provenance is not asked to assert, Portability is not asked to import and
 *   Interoperability is not asked to describe. Composition stays the caller's
 *   decision, visible in the caller's own evidence.
 * - **Reach out.** No filesystem, network, database, chain, RPC, wallet or
 *   provider. Key material either travels inside the `SovereignProof` or comes
 *   from the injected resolver; how *that* finds a key is the adapter's
 *   concern, not this capsule's.
 * - **Branch on the subject.** No namespace, asset type or business domain is
 *   read. Cryptographic verification is subject-type neutral: an alien
 *   namespace, a property registry, an external token system, an AI agent and
 *   an API resource all verify through exactly the same architecture.
