 * no governance decision: no policy is evaluated, no grant is issued or
 * checked, no access is authorized, no credential is brokered, nothing is
 * enforced, priced, metered or rate-limited. Those are AOC Enterprise
 * concerns and are absent by construction, not by convention.
 *

 * mineral inventory read-only and a registration API here would undo that
 * from the other end.
 *
 * ## Three outcomes, three shapes
 *
 * 1. **Accepted and completed** — a `SovereigntyCapabilityResult`, either
 *    `succeeded` or `failed`, always carrying portable evidence. An expected
 *    capability failure is this, not an exception.
 * 2. **Rejected before execution** — throws with code
 *    `SOVEREIGNTY_CAPABILITY_INVOCATION_REJECTED` and no evidence. The
 *    invocation was never accepted, so claiming evidence that it "occurred"
 *    would be false, and the implementation is never called.
 * 3. **Implementation fault or evidence-delivery failure** — throws with
 *    code `SOVEREIGNTY_CAPABILITY_IMPLEMENTATION_ERROR` or
 *    `SOVEREIGNTY_CAPABILITY_EVIDENCE_DELIVERY_FAILED`, carrying the
 *    sanitized evidence that was built. A thrown implementation is a bug,
 *    not a capability result, and is never quietly converted into one.
 *
 * The implementation is invoked at most once in every path.
